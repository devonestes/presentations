# Code Server 💾

???

* We know this because the BEAM (which is the VM that Elixir & Erlang applications run on) has a
thing called a Code Server.
* Let's try and understand this quickly before moving on.

---
class: center, middle

![](/assets/images/cs1.jpg)

???

You can think of the code server as a big key-value store, where keys are function names and
values are bytecode for functions. This part of the code server is called the `global export
table`.

---
class: center, middle

![](/assets/images/cs2.jpg)

???

For the most part (of course there are exceptions), the code server deals with modules. You can
load or unload a module from the code server, and the code server actually keeps _two_ versions of
a module around if you load a new one! This is how hot code loading works, by the way, and the
whole "keeping the current and previous version around" thing is so you can roll back if there's a
problem.

---
class: padding, middle

```
iex(1)> fun = fn -> :ok end
#Function<45.40011524/0 in :erl_eval.expr/5>
```
???

Each function in our application has a name. This name is usually the MFA (module, function &
arity), but even private and anonymous functions actually have names in the BEAM code server.

---
class: center, middle

![](/assets/images/cs3.jpg)

???

And in reality, the .beam files that Elixir (and other BEAM languages) emit are really just
instructions about how to populate this code server! That's why we get one .beam file for each
module.

---
class: center, middle

![](/assets/images/cs4.jpg)

???

So, we've got .beam files, and these .beam files populate the code server, and the code server
holds instructions for functions.

---
class: center, middle

![](/assets/images/cs5.jpg)

???

When you boot a node, you can give it one (or more) paths to directories where .beam files are
stored - this is called (plainly enough) the `code path`. This `code path` can even be changed at
runtime if you're in interactive mode (there are two modes for a BEAM node).

So this code server is really, really important, and especially important to the task we're
undertaking today of trying to get ExUnit to run on multiple nodes.

Another thing to mention - Elixir also has its own code server! But that's really just used for
compilation, and so we're not going to cover that today. We'll be covering some stuff that's
private in Elixir & ExUnit, but the Elixir code server is super duper private, and so I just
wanted to make sure folks knew this existed so there's no confusion.

Ok, so now that we've got a bit of that learning about how ExUnit works, and how the code server
works, let's get back to the task at hand!

---

# Monkey Patching ExUnit 🐒

???

So, here's the plan - since the unit of parallelism in ExUnit is the module, not the test, we're
going to try distributing this work by modules and not by individual tests. This means that module
A runs on machine 1, module B runs on machine 2, etc.

---
class: middle, padding

```
def loop(:async) do
  case wait_for_module(:async) do
    {:ok, mod} ->
      spawn(fn -> run_module(mod) end)
      loop(:async)

    {:error, :no_more_async_modules} ->
      loop(:sync)
  end
end
```

???

* So if this is where the parallelism happens in ExUnit's runner, let's try and make it
distributed in the simplest possible way.

---
class: middle, padding

```
def loop(:async) do
  case wait_for_module(:async) do
    {:ok, mod} ->
      `node = Enum.random([Node.self() | Node.list()])`
      spawn(fn -> run_module(mod) end)
      loop(:async)

    {:error, :no_more_async_modules} ->
      loop(:sync)
  end
end
```

???

* First, let's get a node on which we can run this. For now we'll just do a random node from all
nodes in the cluster.
* And an extra special note for those of you playing along at home - in this specific case
`Enum.random` will actually always give us the same node and not a random one - but for now we're
going to pretend like it would so we can move faster!

---
class: middle, padding

```
def loop(:async) do
  case wait_for_module(:async) do
    {:ok, mod} ->
      node = Enum.random([Node.self() | Node.list()])
      `Node.spawn(node, fn -> run_module(mod) end)`
      loop(:async)

    {:error, :no_more_async_modules} ->
      loop(:sync)
  end
end
```

???

* Node.spawn/2 just lets us spawn a process on a given node.
* So this is the change we'd like to make - how are we able to do that?

---
class: middle, padding

```
# test/test_helper.exs

defmodule ExUnit.Runner do
  # our new implementation
end

ExUnit.start()
```

???

And this is how we actually do our monkey patching! We re-define the module in our
`test_helper.exs` file, because that's loaded after we start our VM for the first time.

We need to remember that we're copying & pasting the WHOLE MODULE, and then making the changes
that we want to make.

---
class: center, middle, img-full

![I know the way!](/assets/images/i_know_the_way.gif)

???

* And we're off! But, almost right away it starts to kind of blow up.

---
class: padding, middle

```
1) Example.Test.A: failure on setup_all callback, all tests have been invalidated
     ** (UndefinedFunctionError) function Example.Test.A.__ex_unit__/2 is undefined or private.
     Did you mean one of:

           * __ex_unit__/0
           * __ex_unit__/2

     stacktrace:
       Example.Test.A.__ex_unit__(:setup_all, %{case: Example.Test.A, module: Example.Test.A})
```

???

* You'll actually get a spectacularly confusing error here!
* Usually this sort of thing in Elixir is considered a bug, but since we're _WAY_ off the beaten
path here and doing a lot of things we shouldn't be doing, I don't blame them for this.
* But I'll help you cut to the chase here. Remember that code server we spoke about just a few minutes ago???
* This is happening because of there are two different code servers!
* Another cool thing about ExUnit - it has its own compiler!
* Our test modules are defined in .exs files, and that means they're not compiled by the standard
Elixir compiler.
* When we run `mix test`, it compiles and loads all our test files (based on the `_test.exs`
suffix) into the code server for the BEAM node that we've just started.
* It does a bunch of other stuff, too!

* So, we need to make sure that when we compile our actual test modules, that those get loaded
onto all the code servers in our cluster.

# Remote code loading
]

```
path = :code.get_path()



  
    
　   
```

???

* Now, normally if you want to load code into a code server, you can do that by
sharing the code path.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Remote code loading
]

```
path = :code.get_path()
:rpc.multicall(Node.list(), :code, :set_path, [path])





```

???


* Remember, we can set that at runtime!

---
class: padding

.center[
# Remote code loading
]

```
path = :code.get_path()
:rpc.multicall(Node.list(), :code, :set_path, [path])

# or



```

???


* But for these .exs files, we don't actually write .beam files to disk, so that won't work!

---
class: padding

.center[
# Remote code loading
]

```
path = :code.get_path()
:rpc.multicall(Node.list(), :code, :set_path, [path])

# or

{module, binary, filename} = :code.get_object_code(Example.Test.A)

```

???

* The other normal way you can load code into a code server is by giving the code server the info
it would normally find in the .beam file via a function call to `:code.load_binary/3`. This works
well for sure, but there's kind of another hitch.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Remote code loading
]

```
path = :code.get_path()
:rpc.multicall(Node.list(), :code, :set_path, [path])

# or

{module, binary, filename} = :code.get_object_code(Example.Test.A)
:rpc.multicall(Node.list(), :code, :load_binary, [module, filename, binary])
```

???

* Normally when you do this, you would get the info for the code you want to load with
`:code.get_object_code/1`. But that doesn't actually pull the code from the code server - it pulls
it from the .beam files - and since we don't have .beam files for these test modules,
:code.get_object_code/1 errors!
* So, we've gotta make another change to how ExUnit works.
* One thing that we sort of skipped earlier is how ExUnit compiles these test modules.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Test Compiler
]

```
case Kernel.ParallelCompiler.require(test_files, callbacks) do
  {:ok, _, _} -> :ok
  {:error, _, _} -> exit({:shutdown, 1})
end











```

???

* ExUnit actually has its own compiler that is uses to find & compile your test modules for you.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Test Compiler
]

```
case Kernel.ParallelCompiler.require(test_files, callbacks) do
  {:ok, _, _} -> :ok
  {:error, _, _} -> exit({:shutdown, 1})
end

# becomes



```

???

* Basically, we need to modify this compiler so we load all the test modules on all nodes.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Test Compiler
]

```
case Kernel.ParallelCompiler.require(test_files, callbacks) do
  {:ok, _, _} -> :ok
  {:error, _, _} -> exit({:shutdown, 1})
end

# becomes

{results, _} = :rpc.multicall(Kernel.ParallelCompiler, :require, [test_files, callbacks])

Enum.each(results, fn
  {:ok, _, _} -> :ok
  {:error, _, _} -> exit({:shutdown, 1})
end)
```

???

* With this change we'll now compile and load all the test files on all nodes instead of just the
one that was started when you ran `mix test`.
* This means that your cluster must be set up before you get to this point.

---
class: center, middle

# 🎉

???

* And, woah - now it works! Kind of. Again, the simple version of this process I showed for
ExUnit's runner is a simplification, but the real change that we need to make isn't much more
complicated.

---
class: padding, middle

```
{test_module, invalid_tests, finished_tests} = run_module(config, test_module, to_run_tests)


# becomes


{test_module, invalid_tests, finished_tests} =
  :rpc.call(node, __MODULE__, :run_module, [config, test_module, to_run_tests])
```

???

* Not so bad, right?!
* There were a few other changes I made to this to make it work in my example, which is on GitHub
if you want to look through it and try it for yourself in a way that will show you the benefit
even if you just have a single machine (as long as it has at least 4 cores).

???

* This was with me adding an extra 2 nodes, one with 2 cores and one with 4 cores
* 80% faster than in series
* 48% faster than parallel
* Given 26 cores and a bit of optimization, you could get this down to the time it take to
basically just run a single test, so probably around 1 second.
* So, you might be thinking to yourself right now "this sounds great! We can set up super-fast CI
servers with a couple raspberry PIs that can run a long test suite super quick!"

![](/assets/images/draw_an_owl.jpg)

???

* You may have seen this joke before about how to draw an owl. The idea is that by making the
beginning of it seem super easy that the whole process then looks easy when it's really quite
hard.

---
class: center, middle

![](/assets/images/draw_an_owl_circled.jpg)

???

* What we covered today was really just that first step in drawing an owl.
* If your Elixir applications store no state at all, or if the application is already designed to
be used in a cluster, then indeed this can work! But most applications really aren't designed to
be run as part of a cluster. If yours is, then great! But it's a non-trivial amount of work to
make that happen, and the errors are really annoying and difficult to debug.

---
class: center, middle

# :code
# :rpc

???

* But, in our journey today we got to learn a bit about how ExUnit works and how the BEAM's code
server works. I think this is really fun stuff to know about, and I hope you agree!
* If your application literally has no state, or if your application is already set up for
distribution, then this could offer some benefit to you. But I'd wager a guess that 99% of folks
don't fit in one of those two buckets.
* So, I still think this is super cool because it shows us a lot of the power of the BEAM and some
of the really amazing things you can do (if you really need it), but because most people don't
need many of these things, it's not super useful to our everyday lives.
* Either way, I hope you learned something interesting and that you enjoyed the talk!
* Erlang gives us the really important stuff we need to make this work, so I'd really recommend
looking into some of the stuff in these modules. If you ever find yourself needing to draw the
rest of that owl, these two modules will likely have some answers for your questions.
