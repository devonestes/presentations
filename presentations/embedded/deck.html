# Get information from experts and research

# Connect to the running node without interruption, add logging, get data, etc.

# 🌐 The Web 🌐

???
# Start small - resist new features!
# Design sprints are great - try them!
# Property testing is awesome!
# Do browser testing &amp; QA!
# Elixir is awesome!
# Please care about security!
# Optimize for shipping!
