# Embedded Application Development
#### (for Web Developers)

???
My name is Devon...

For pretty much all of my career I've been a web developer...

For the last 4 years I've been doing Elixir/Erlang...

Last year, I was contacted by a company who wanted to hire me to work on their
applications. One was something I had seen several times before - a
high-throughput GraphQL API.

But the second was something new to me - an embedded application.

This company was building Point of Sale systems for restaurants and retail
chains in the US, and those POS systems communicated back to that central API
for all kinds of helpful things for owners and operators of these retail
locations.

And powering these POS systems was embedded software, running on dozens of
different kinds of hardware in hundreds of locations across a _very_ large
country. A huge selling point for this company is that their software would be
able to run on your existing POS hardware, and that was a huge challenge.

To put this challenge into web development terms, imagine you're building a web
app that needs to run _perfectly_ in every web browser that's been used over
the last 20 years - and yes, I mean everything from Internet Explorer 5 to
today!

Writing software for one hardware platform isn't so bad, but writing software
for dozens of them - not to mention drivers for dozens of possible peripherals
- is really quite hard!

# What are embedded applications?

???
Nowadays, just about everything we have has some sort of software in it. It can
be really tiny software that doesn't run on any sort of OS, or it can be massive
applications that run on some form of OS (often a version of Linux for these
huge embedded systems).

# Picture of the boys' clock

This is software!

This is the clock that wakes my kids up in the morning. It's cute, and it lights
up green when it's time for them to come out of their room.

I know that it has software in it because sometimes, when my kids wake up early
and don't want to wait for the light to turn green, they'll open up the back
and start smashing all the buttons to try and make it turn green earlier.

Unfortunatley for them, all this does is make the thing freeze up and I need to
turn it off and back on again to make it work again.

So, yeah, that's software for you!

This is also now software!

Tesla famously runs millions of lines of code through their cars, and that
software is _critical_ to the operation of their cars.

# The two types of embedded software

???
Embedded software can be divided up into two broad categories.

--

* Software that gets updated

--

* Software that doesn't get updated

???
When you think about it, this distintion is _huge_, and for many reasons.

If you're shipping software today, can you even imagine what it would be like if
you were only able to ship once? So, every bug that you ship never gets fixed?
No new features are added after you ship? It sure raises the stakes when it
comes to getting things right.

The two examples I just gave illustrate the differences between these two types
of embedded devices. That clock doesn't get any updates. That bug that they
shipped where pushing a certain combination of buttons in a certain amount of
time makes the thing freeze will never get fixed. That's just how that thing
works at this point.

Tesla, however, can also change the code in their cars with the push of a
button, as they do occasionally before natural disasters in the US so they can
give folks extra range and get out of harm's way.

But this raises other concerns, especially around security and privacy.

# IoT is here to stay

???
What's for sure, though, is that right now a great number of our posessions have
software in them, and over time more and more of them will also have more, and
more complicated, software. There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.

# Picture of StarCraft box

Now, the web is surely here to stay as well. But, I'm old enough to remember a
time when I was realy excited to go down to Staples and pick up the newest cool
video game, which came in a physical box, with a physical CD that I would put in
my computer and then spend 10 minutes waiting for it to install before I could
play it.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is - things change, and what do I really know
about what the future holds?

And so, what I'm going to go over today is how I - as someone who spent his
entire career essentially putting spreadsheets on the internet in the form of
web applications - went through the process of learning about developing
embedded systems and how that changed my development style both for embedded
_and_ web applications!

# Design

???
Let's start from the beginning. Before the product is even built, how do you
design it? You can't rapidly iterate on designs because you can't control if
users actually update or not.

You build and test mockups and do lots of user testing. Alpha and Beta users are
crucial.

Design sprints are really helpful here.

Depending on your application, there's almost no way to do anything other that
some version of Waterfall. This doesn't have to be a bad thing! But, the more
you can develop ways to make getting updates to your customers possible, the
better.

# Development

???
Ok, so we have some idea of what we want, but now we need to build it. What do
we need to focus on?

Robustness, fault tolerence are extremely important. Turn it off and on again is
a terrible solution!

You're almost certainly going to have persistant local state in these
applications, so getting that right is really important. This makes shared
mutable state generally a bad idea.

You're likely going to be running on very small hardware with limited resources.
Performance might be something you care about, but you definitely can't run out
of memory - this rules out Ruby.

---

# Testing

???
You can't test in production when you don't have access to production devices.

Property testing is extremely helpful.

A strong type system is really helpful.

---

# Debugging

???
Running an application on dozens of different hardware platforms is really
tricky to get right! How do you debug when things go wrong?

When it comes to debugging, nothing comes close to the helpfulness of connecting
to a running OTP application.

Even finding out if you have bugs can be really tricky since you might need
users to report them, and they often don't.

---

# Security

???
You need to be able to do this without opening up your users to huge security
issues. Especially in this case, where money and financial information is
involved and it's connected to the internet, we needed to be rock solid.

Limit your use of dependencies - this basically rules out JavaScript.
