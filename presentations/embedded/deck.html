# 📦 Shipping 📦

# Maybe device not connected to internet
# If it is, user often needs to accept update

# 5 phases, each over one day
# You need a good facilitator who knows what they're doing

# Get information from experts and research

# Testing

# Move fast & break things - no!
# Bad user experiences can kill a product
