## Getting Started with Mutation Testing in Elixir using Muzak

???

Today we're going to talk about mutation testing, and I'll also give a quick introduction to a
mutation testing tool for Elixir that I've written called Muzak.

Many folks haven't heard of mutation testing before, though, so let's first give an introduction
to that.

## What is mutation testing?

???

In short, mutation testing is the process of systematically introducing bugs into your code and
then running your tests to see if that bug is caught by a failing test or some other error, like a
compilation error.

What does that look like? Well, let's look at some examples!

---
class: padding

```
defmodule CoverExample do
  def write_json_to_file(map, path) do
    json = Jason.encode!(map)
    File.write(json, path)
    json
  end
end
```

???

Here's a function that takes a map, converts it to JSON and writes it to a file.
Pretty simple, right?!

--

```
defmodule CoverExampleTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  describe "write_json_to_file/2" do
    @tag :tmp_dir
    test "gives us the correct JSON", context do
      map = %{"test" => "map"}
      assert CoverExample.write_json_to_file(map, context.tmp_dir) == Jason.encode!(map)
    end
  end
end
```

???

And we even have a test for that function, and it passes! Of course we only have 3 lines of code
here, so we have 100% test coverage according to `cover`. But can we break this code without
causing a failing test?!

---
class: padding

```
defmodule CoverExample do
  def write_json_to_file(map, path) do
    json = Jason.encode!(map)
    # File.write(json, path)
    json
  end
end
```

```
defmodule CoverExampleTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  describe "write_json_to_file/2" do
    @tag :tmp_dir
    test "gives us the correct JSON", context do
      map = %{"test" => "map"}
      assert CoverExample.write_json_to_file(map, context.tmp_dir) == Jason.encode!(map)
    end
  end
end
```

???

We sure can! As we see in the test, we're not testing the side effect of writing to the file. If
we were to really break that code, we would see that we still have our passing test and we still
have 100% code coverage according to `cover`.

And you want to know something else? Did anybody notice anything funny about that first version of
the code?

---
class: padding

```
defmodule CoverExample do
  def write_json_to_file(map, path) do
    json = Jason.encode!(map)
    `File.write(json, path)`
    json
  end
end
```

```
defmodule CoverExampleTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  describe "write_json_to_file/2" do
    @tag :tmp_dir
    test "gives us the correct JSON", context do
      map = %{"test" => "map"}
      assert CoverExample.write_json_to_file(map, context.tmp_dir) == Jason.encode!(map)
    end
  end
end
```

???

Maybe with this line?

That's right - even the first version of this code that we _thought_ was correct probably wasn't
doing what we wanted it to do because the arguments to `File.write/2` are flipped!

???
So this is one of the major benefits - probably _the_ major benefit for most people - that
Mutation Testing offers us - it shows us what behavior is untested by systematically breaking our
applications and then seeing what's caught by our tests.

---
class: center, middle

# Mutation Testing tests your tests!
#### &nbsp;
# Missing tests
# Duplicate tests
# &nbsp;

???

But that's not all! As it executes, we can keep track of which tests pass and which tests fail,
and then do a little bit of math and statistics to tell us which tests always fail together. This
would possible indicate that two tests are essentially duplicates, meaning that you might be able
to delete one of them!

---
class: center, middle

# Mutation Testing tests your tests!
#### &nbsp;
# Missing tests
# Duplicate tests
# Invalid tests

???

And it can also tell us if there are tests that _never_ fail! I know I've encountered a couple
tests that, due to some heavy use of mocks, weren't actually testing anything in the
implementation. I could literally delete the entire implementation of the code that was supposedly
under test and the tests would still pass. Mutation testing can find these for us.

---
class: padding

```
defmodule CoverExample do
  def write_json_to_file(map, path) do
    json = Jason.encode!(map)
    `File.write(json, path)`
    json
  end
end
```

```
defmodule CoverExampleTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  describe "write_json_to_file/2" do
    @tag :tmp_dir
    test "gives us the correct JSON", context do
      map = %{"test" => "map"}
      assert CoverExample.write_json_to_file(map, context.tmp_dir) == Jason.encode!(map)
    end
  end
end
```

???

Let's go back to this code for a second, though. What if this code has been running in production
for a while, and it's not causing any problems? Maybe this means that the writing of that JSON to
a file isn't really needed? Maybe we can _delete_ some of this code!

This is another thing that Mutation Testing can help us with. Sometimes it's the **tests** that
are correct and not the code, meaning that we can delete some unneeded code!

# Coverage based on **logic**, not **lines**

???

But this is the big thing that most people are going to want. It's a measure of code coverage
based on what really matters in our applications - its logic.

Why is measuring code coverage based on lines not enough? Well, we've already seen one example
where we had 100% coverage based on LOC, but there's another common way in which that measurement
doesn't find everything for us. Let's look at another example.

---
class: padding, middle

```
defmodule Authorization do
  def user_can_modify?(user, resource) do
    user.role in [:admin, :owner] or user.id in resource.member_ids
  end
end
```

???

This is a situation where we have three possible branches in the logic, but all three of them are
on the same line. Coverage based on LOC will show us as 100% covered if we test any one of those -
or as we saw before, if we just hit that line and don't actually test anything! Mutation testing
will show us specifically if we're testing this logic.

I don't think we want to live in a world where we need to have exactly one possible branch in the
logic on each line of code just to make our tools work well for us!

# Problems?

???

So I've spoken a lot about what Mutation Testing can offer us, and if it were all rainbows and
sunshine then it would be a no-brainer that everyone should use it all the time, right?!

Well, the big problem that we when we want to use mutation testing is how _long_ it takes to run!

---
class: center, middle, headline

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èRuntimeüèÉüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

???

Which, when you think about it, makes sense, right? We need to generate what is often thousands or
tens of thousands of possible mutations in an application, and then potentially run our entire
test suite for each of them. That's thousands of test suite runs, and that can really add up!

# Filtering and ordering what what mutated
# &nbsp;

???

Basically you have two options to reduce the runtime - you can filter what gets mutated,

---
class: center, middle

# Filtering and ordering what what mutated
# Filtering and ordering your tests

???

And you can filter which tests are run.

Luckily these are thing that can make a huge difference, and in basically any mutation testing
library some version of this needs to be implemented, otherwise mutation testing is generally
unusble because it can take literally _days_ to run otherwise.

## Muzak & Muzak Pro

???

This brings me to the real fun part here today - I've written such a mutation testing library that
I've called Muzak, and I wanted to show a bit of it to y'all!

So Muzak is on Hex now, and it should give you a basic introduction to mutation testing if you
wanted to try it out on one of your projects. Muzak Pro, however, is mutation testing designed for
teams, and for use in things like your CI pipeline. It is a paid product, though, as this is a
_ton_ of work to do and in general I'm more comfortable with selling something than I am with
asking for sponsorship or donations, and so that's why I went this route.
