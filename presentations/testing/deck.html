# Testing in Elixir

???
* Because we don't have a whiteboard I'm writing this stuff down here

---

## Two classes of tests

### Tests that call functions
### Tests that simulate a user

???
* There are, broadly speaking, two classes of tests

---
class: center, middle

## Tests that call functions

???
* Might be called a unit test or something like that, but in Elixir we just have functions and
data, and you can't test data, so we test functions! Today we'll call these unit tests, with the
"unit" being a function.

## Tests that simulate a user

???
* These might be called feature tests, or integration tests, or blackbox tests, or any number of
names. For today we'll call them feature tests.
* If you're lucky enough to have an API that just involves calling functions (like for a library),
then you don't even really have this kind of test!

## Tests (generally) have two possible things to test

### Return value
### Side effects

???
* In general, these are the two things we're testing. This is a bit of a simplification, as "side
effects" is a really, really broad category of things. But generally, when we write a test, we're
doing doing one thing (calling a function or hitting an HTTP endpoint, or using a CLI command),
and that action has a return value (or not!), and it has side effects (or not!).

## Always test them both!

???
* Whenever you write a test, you need to make assertions about the return value of the function or
operation (if there is one), and then about the side effects of the function or operation (if
there are any).
* This is _super_ important!

## What is a side effect?

### DB reads/writes
### `send/1` or `receive`
### anything async
### filesystem
### system or application environment

???
* Most of the stuff that makes an application worth using, basically. In general, we're
programming to get side effects.

---

## What about mocks/calling other functions as a side effect?

???
* Like all things, there are tradeoffs here. The tradeoff is coupling vs. simplicity of testing.
* It's far easier to say "this function takes some parameters, creates a CSV and uploads it to S3"
when describing the behavior of a function instead of saying "this function takes some parameters,
calls the CSV.create/2 function, and then pipes that to the S3.upload_csv/3 function."
* When you're using a function, you want to know what it does, and saying "it calls these other
functions" isn't a really helpful description usually, and couples you to the implementation of
those functions.
* The first version is completely independent of the implementation - you can delete those other
two functions and inline them, and the test is still valid.
* Both are valid, but I strongly prefer the latter, and for most cases you probably should, too,
since it allows you to change implementations without needing to change your tests.
