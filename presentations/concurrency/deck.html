## Comparing Common Concurrency Patterns
### in Elixir and Erlang

???
* Who here knows Erlang / Elixir?
* Process is an Actor.
* They communicate through message passing, and each process has an ordered inbox.
* Concurrency & Parallelism are great, but you need to know how to use them.
* People are thinking about these things.

???
* Paper first published in 1999.
* Patterns are great, because they give us shared vocabulary.
* This makes communication easier, and that's the hard part of programming.

???
* Published by Addison-Wesley in 2004
* Great acronym!

* I had kind of hoped there would be a really good acronym for the title for this talk.

* But then I remembered that this one was sort of taken already.

---

???

* The highlight (for me) from that original paper is this chart.
* It shows the basic layout of the patterns they identify and named.
* Now, because it's a 20 year old paper that was kind of hard to read, so I made this.

???

* Now we see that we start at the beginning, and there are decision points that help us get to our
final pattern.
* Usually patterns aren't prescriptions, but in this case they are!
* But not all of them are really _for_ us.
* 20 years ago - and really to an extent still today - most people thinking about this aren't
thiking at our scale.

???

* A lot of the research on this is for people doing theoritical astrophysics simulations with
giant supercomputers trying to do as much vector math as they can.
* But that doesn't mean we can't still benefit from a bit of this!
* Even though we aren't (and shouldn't) just do what they do cause "it's what they do at Google."

projects!
* Fourth one is so simple we can just cover it quickly.

## Embarrassingly Parallel

???

* Best name of them all!
* One example is sending emails.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Embarrassingly Parallel
]

```
def send_emails(emails) do # serial
  Enum.map(emails, fn email ->
    send_email(email)
  end)
end
```

???

* Here we map over the list of emails, sending them in series.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Embarrassingly Parallel
]

```
def send_emails(emails) do # serial
  Enum.map(emails, fn email ->
    send_email(email)
  end)
end

def send_emails(emails) do # parallel
  Enum.map(emails, fn email ->
    spawn(fn -> send_email(email) end)
  end)
end
```

???

* Making this paralell is as simple as spawning one process per email.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Embarrassingly Parallel
]

```
def send_emails(emails) do # serial
  Enum.map(emails, fn email ->
    send_email(email)
  end)
end

def send_emails(emails) do # parallel
  Enum.map(emails, fn email ->
    `spawn`(fn -> send_email(email) end)
  end)
end
```

???

* Now they all send in parallel - great!

- ## Eagerly evaluated, linear input

--

- ## No communication with parent

- ## No communication with siblings

- ## No shared dependencies between siblings

???

* Simplest, and probably one of the more common ones.
* But the most common one gives us just a little bit more.

## Reduction

???

* This one may be know by its other names - async/await & map/reduce.
* Quite a lot like Embarrassingly Parallel, but with one important difference.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Reduction
]

```
defmodule Parallel do
  def map(collection, func) do
    refs =
      Enum.map(collection, fn element ->
        Task.async(fn -> func.(element) end)
      end)

    Enum.map(refs, fn ref ->
      Task.await(ref, :infinity))
    end)
  end
end
```

???

* We map over our input, partitioning it in some fashion (one element per child process)
* Then reduce the output of that partitioned work back into a single result.

---
class: padding

.center[
# Reduction
]

```
defmodule Parallel do
  def map(collection, func) do
    refs =
      Enum.map(collection, fn element ->
        `Task.async`(fn -> func.(element) end)
      end)

    Enum.map(refs, fn ref ->
      `Task.await`(ref, :infinity))
    end)
  end
end

```

???

* We get a lot from the Task module
* I think it's important to go one level deeper here.

* Map in parallel, but reduction in series.
* Other ways to optimize, but this is generally ok.
* You could technically do this recursively for partitions of partitions.
* Let's look at an example to make it more clear.

---
class: padding

.hidden[
# _
]

```
me = self()

fun = fn seconds ->
  Process.sleep(seconds * 1000)    # Simulate some expensive work
  send(me, Time.utc_now().second)
end
```

--

```
Time.utc_now().second              #=> 48
```

--

```
Parallel.map([1, 2, 3, 1], fun)    #=> [49, 50, 51, 49]
```

--

```
Time.utc_now().second              #=> 51
```

???

* The computation is done in parallel, but reduce is done in series.
* And now in pictures!

* This is one where we have a huge advantage over the academics.

## Asynchronous Decomposition

???

* As you might imagine, dealing with data structures of unknown - and posssibly infinite! - size
is a real bummer in languages like C where you need to pre-allocate memory.
* For us it's not so bad, but I think it's still significant enough of a differnce to deserve its
own pattern.

  # ...

def loop(:sync) do
  # ...
end

def run_module(mod) do
  # ...
end

def run_test(test) do
  # ...
end
```

???

* On the face of it, you might think that this problem - run a bunch of tests in parallel - is
just another Reduction.
* In Elixir, test files aren't compiled - they're only compiled at run time.
* The process doing the partitioning (the parent) doesn't know exactly how much stuff it's going
to handle.

- ## No communication between siblings

- ## No shared dependencies between siblings

???

* Trust me - if you run your tests in parallel with shared dependencies it's going to be a really
bummer.
* Dependencies are more than just what's in memory! Databases, file systems, third-party
dependencies, etc!
* Could we simplify this and use Reduction here instead?

.center[
# ExUnit As Reduction
]

```
def run() do
  {sync_modules, async_modules} = load_modules()

  results =
    Parallel.map(async_modules, &run_module/1) ++
      Enum.map(sync_modules, &run_module/1)

  format_results(results)
end
```

???

* Yeah, sure, kind of! It would be slower, but it would indeed work.
* The big difference here again is just the input - eagerly or lazily evaluated.
* Again, this is a much bigger difference when you're working in C or something, but it's still
important for clear communication.

## Pipeline Processing

???

* The other great thing about Asynchronous Decomposition is how it serves as a sort of middle
groud to this next pattern.
* This is what it sounds like. You may have heard of or seen other examples of this in the past.
* The thing is, doing this _right_ is actually quite hard, and so if you need to reach for this,
you really don't want to write your own.

them.
