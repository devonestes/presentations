# Comparing Common Concurrency Patters
#### in Elixir and Erlang

???
My name is Devon...

One of the things that many people love about the BEAM is the wonderful support
for concurrent computation. Not just concurrent, but truly parallel. If you want
to peg all of your CPU cores at 100%, you can easily do that thanks to the BEAM.

But the thing is, you still need to design those systems. And that's what we're
going to be talking about today. Specifically, we're going to be looking at two
open source examples of some concurrent computation.

# Benchee vs. ExUnit

???

Both ExUnit and Benchee have some parallel computation involved in their
execution. Specifically, both of these problems are - and I'm not making this
term up here - embarassingly parallel. This term is for problems that can be
executed entirely in parallel without any communication between the processes.

# Show picture of squares in squares

???

This basically means that we have a problem that can be broken down into smaller
sub-problems. And occasionally those sub-problems can also be broken down
further as well. And off of these divisions can be run in parallel. You may of
heard of map-reduce - well, that's sort of what this is.

# Parallel Map Reduce vs. Event Manager

???

Benchee and ExUnit handle this basic problem in two ways. We're going to call
those two options Parallel Map Reduce and an Event Manager. Each of these
implementations has some pros and cons - that's like the story of all software,
right? It's all about tradeoffs.

So, let's look at these two implemenations, discuss the tradeoffs, and hopefully
we'll have a deeper understanding of these two options so you can make some good
choices when it comes time to implement something like this yourselves.
